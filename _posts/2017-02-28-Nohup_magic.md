title: How to keep things running after you close your terminal (Linux/Unix)

When you start playing with cloud computing like [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), you will, sometimes, decide to launch a program that will take a while to run. If you simply close the connection before all processes are finished, the system will terminate [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (or whatever [shell](http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/ch01sec07.html) you were using) and, therefore, your program will be also terminated. Normally, when we are working on a terminal, we make use of the `&` (or `ctrl+z` and `bg`) to send things to the background freeing the terminal. If you sent your process to background, you will be able to use [`jobs`](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-jobs-command-examples-usage-syntax/) to display information about processes that are sleeping (the `ctrl+z` thing) or running on the background.

The problem here is that your processes running on the background will be terminated anyway. There are at least two solutions. The simplest one is installing [`nohup`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nohup) on your computer (in case it's not already available):

```
$ sudo apt-get install nohup
```

With `nohup`, you really just need to add it in front of your normal command and send it to the background (e.g. `$ nohup ls &`). By default, a file called `nohup.out` will be created with all the output ([stdout/stderr](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3385261)) generated by your program. You can find more "nohup stuff" [here](http://linux.101hacks.com/unix/nohup-command/).

The second option is to manually do what `nohup` does, but using `disown`. This is explained [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/625436). You will need to send your process to background (`&` or `ctrl+z` and `bg`), verify its job number with `jobs -l` and then:

```
$ disown -h job_number_you_just_found
```

**UPDATE (05/03/2017):**

Today, I was launching some simulations on a server and I decided to do it using `&&` to make sure the next step would only be executed if the previous had finished without errors. The [solution](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/47230/how-to-execute-multiple-command-using-nohup), using `nohup`:

```
$ nohup sh -c 'first_command && second_command' &
```

That's it. Have a happy cloud computing experience!


Cheers!
