This is my first attempt using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It all started because my colleague, Massimiliano, showed me his brand new Jekyll based [website](http://mpatacchiola.github.io/). Actually, I'd tried Jekyll before, but when I read the [first lines](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) asking me to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I instantaneously gave up. I was way too used to deploy and admin WordPress websites, so I could not accept the idea of not being able to have a web-only system. Luckily, Github does everything and it's NOT necessary to install anything on you computer to use Jekyll with Github!

My plan, for the future, is to keep this website updated with what I'm currently doing (and, maybe, try to document some old projects too).

And, finally, here it is:
<div class="message">
  Hello, World!
</div>

This website was created using the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).
