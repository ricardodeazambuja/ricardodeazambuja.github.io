title: Hello World!

This is my first attempt using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It all started because my colleague, Massimiliano, showed me his brand new Jekyll based [website](http://mpatacchiola.github.io/). Actually, I'd tried Jekyll before, but when I read the first line asking me to install Ruby, RubyGems, NodeJS and then install Jekyll, I instantaneously gave up.

My plan, for the future, is to keep this website updated with what I'm currently doing (and, maybe, try to document some old projects too).

And, finally, here it is:
<div class="message">
  Hello World!
</div>


This website was created using the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).
