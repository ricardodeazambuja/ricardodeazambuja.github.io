My apologies. I seem to have totally ignored the existence of the Disqus comments in this blog. Yesterday, I randomly read some article showing all the tracking Disqus does on people and I didn't like that. I was using it just because I thought it was an easy way to have comments that looked like a forum. So, until I find a new way to add comments to this blog without the risk of people being tracked, I will keep this blog without comments. If you have a suggestion, please, [get in touch](https://ricardodeazambuja.com/about/).
