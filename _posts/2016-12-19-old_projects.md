Today I've decided to write something to make sure I'm not going to forget, again, about my old projects. When I was still an undergrad student (2000-2005), mobile phones with good quality cameras were not available and only in 2004 (or 2005?) I got one with a really noisy, probably VGA, camera.  I was only able to have such a phone because I found an unsolvable bug on my old one, while still on guarantee, and they had no choice but give me a better one (Brazil has some really nice consumer protection laws). Also, Dropbox, GoogleDrive, etc were not available and it was quite common to lose data from time to time after a problem with a hard drive. 

During my year as an undergrad Electrical Enginnering student, I've developed some interesting projects, but most of them I've not saved any picture, schematic, etc. For one of my analog electronics modules, my group designed a circuit to multiply two input signals using only transistors. I still remember that Analog Devices had one IC that could do exactly what we strugled to build for that module. The control systems module demanded us to develop an analog PID controller and I implemented a controller for CPU fans. Later on, I've worked on a Neural Network implementation using FPGA that should be able to recognise simple numbers. All those projects are lost, since I don't have backup of anything or photos. My first project to have a digital picture saved was during the microcontrollers module. My group designed a home automation system, based on 8051, where you could activate relays through DTMF. Here is the picture:

Luckly, my final project was preserved (thanks to the aforehead noisy mobile camera) and now I managed to upload it to github too ([TEXVID](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/TEXvid)). It was based on the Microchip PIC16F and entirely written in Assembly!

So, back in 2006, I had this idea of building my own CNC router. It was not an easy task in Brazil at that time because, sometimes, we could not find the most basic parts (with a reasonable price). Also, I had just got married and moved to a new house and I didn't have proper tools.
