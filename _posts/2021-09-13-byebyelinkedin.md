Today, I decided to close my LinkedIn account. I'd been mulling over this idea for a while, trying to weigh the PROS/CONS. The final result was that I couldn't see much value on having that account, and I also realized I should be posting things on my own website instead :smiley:


I still have my twitter account ([@rdeazambuja78](https://twitter.com/rdeazambuja78)), but I'm thinking about shutting it down as well.
