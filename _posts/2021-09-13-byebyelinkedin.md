Today, I decided to close my LinkedIn account. I'd been mulling over this idea for a while, trying to weigh the PROS/CONS. The final result was that I couldn't see much value on having that account, and I also realized I should be posting things on my own website instead :smiley:


I still have my twitter account ([@rdeazambuja78](https://twitter.com/rdeazambuja78)), but I'm thinking about shutting it down as well.

**UPDATE (23/12/2021):**
I decided to re-open my account because it was too deeply available on the search engines and I became afraid someone could takeover it to create a fake accout. So, now I'm back to LinkedIn, but without any contacts and almost zero personal info available for the time being.
