This webside already has an [Advanced QR code Generator](https://ricardodeazambuja.com/qrcodegenerator/), but as the name says, it only generates QR codes. The nice thing about QR codes is that anyone can read them directly from the smartphone camera app (at least modern ones). However, there are other codes that you need to install an app only for reading them. I'm not a big fan of installing "yet-another-phone-app", so I decided to fix this problem creating "yet-another-web-app" called Barcode Tool - Generator & Scanner!
