title: Easy-peasy Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks with Keras
category: deep learning
draft: true
---
Deep learning... wow... currently this is "the" hot topic! I've attended a few seminars and workshops about deep learning, nevertheless I'd never tried to code something myself because I had always another [priority](http://www.tastefullyoffensive.com/2013/09/the-12-types-of-procrastnators.html). Also, I have to admit, I thought it was a lot harder and I would need a lot of time to be able to run anything but sample code.

My hope is that, at the end of this post:
- [ ] You will be convinced to stop everything you are doing and give Keras a try!
- [ ] Capable to create your very own first deep neural network (ok, not *that* deep).
- [ ] And, to show off, improve the previous example using a convolutional neural network.

Am I going to reinvent the wheel? Hopefully not! I will use my very strong [*Google-fu*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Google-fu) to find something we can reuse.

This is a draft... yep, I do tests with the production website :D
