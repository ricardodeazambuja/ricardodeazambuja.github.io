title: Secure Self-Landing for Unmanned Aircraft Systems SSL-UAS
---
## Project Description:
This project interlaces three different disciplines: vision, machine learning and cyber security, to achieve the overall goal of creating a new generation of autonomous drones that can safely land indoors or outdoors, if problems arise with their navigational and sensory systems, whether due to accident, technical failure, or attack. In addition, the project aims to provide these drones with important safety features such as automated object/human in-motion avoidance capabilities, which support the objectives of regulations either in effect or are being drafted for this purpose.

## My role in this project:
I led the development of the safe-landing vision system and managed junior researchers working on the project.
