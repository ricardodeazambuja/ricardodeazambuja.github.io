## ...This Website
On this website, I'll try to present some of the things I'm currently working on and also some of my old projects. As an Engineer, I'm always looking forward learning and trying new things. So, I hope you will enjoy it!

## ...Me
I'm an Electrical Engineer (Five Years, Full Time, just a few survivors at the end...) with a M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering / Automation (Two Years, Full Time, maybe even less survivors at the end...), both from [UFRGS](http://www.ufrgs.br/english/home). My undergrad certificate says "Electrical Engineer" and my training had the basic blocks from traditional Electrical Engineering degrees, but it was also strongly focused on what most people would recognize nowadays as an Electronics degree (Microcontrollers, Digital Electronics, Control Systems, Digital Communications, Power Electronics, etc). To give you an idea, my final project (yes, in my previous university the undergrads have to produce a dissertation and defend it during a public presentation, oral examination, with three examiners) was a system to write messages using composite video signals ([TEXvid](https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/TEXvid)). My M.Sc., again, had a dissertation and public presentation, but one of the examiner was invited from another university. The results from my M.Sc. (Wireless Power Transmission) can be seen on my [publications](../publications/).  
I've been an entrepreneur since ever ([Engineering Company](http://ricardodeazambuja.com/azamec/index_e.html), Bookshop, Publishing House, Express Printing Services, Website Development, etc) and nowadays I'm a Ph.D candidate working with Spiking Neural Networks applied to Robot Control (one more time, please, check my [publications](../publications/)). I love electronics, robotics and, whenever I can, I try to design and build new things using wood or 3D printed parts, but sometimes I also enjoy taking old things apart to reuse or just to see what is inside!

### Old projects
If you want to see a little bit about some of my old projects, I've a post that talks exactly about them:
